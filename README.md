Journey through all the features of the micro:bit with interactive activities and engaging projects to excite and enthuse learners. The course uses makecode as the programming interface and is suitable for learners of all ages and abilities. 

### All material has now been updated to include microbit V2.

## Resource Aim
This course introduces learners to the key STEM topics of physical computing, sensors, programming and Internet of Things (IoT) through project-based learning. Learners are immersed in a series of projects which involve rapid team-based development of a solution to meet specified criteria. These sprints of project-based work are interspersed with theory lessons that cover the core concepts necessary for the following projects.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
