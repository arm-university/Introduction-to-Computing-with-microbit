# How to Contribute
The Arm School Program (ASP) has made Introduction to Computing with micro:bit open for modification and additions. Contributions are an important part of our materials, and our goal is to make it as simple as possible to become a contributor.

ASP uses the following license - [Licence.md](https://github.com/arm-university/Introduction-to-Computing-with-microbit/blob/main/Licence.md)

To encourage collaboration, as well as robust, consistent and maintainable content, we have developed a set of guidelines for contributing to these materials.

## How to contribute 
We accept contributions in the form of **marked up word documents (please use track changes)**. All potential changes are reviewed before they are accepted. The review includes but is not limited to: functional correctness, style or formatting, as well as a review of any content amendments. If any of the reviews fail, more work will be needed before we accept the contribution.

By proposing a change for content on GitHub, you agree to license your contributions under the same license as the original material. This is commonly referred to as "inbound=outbound". This enables contributions to happen in a quick and effortless way and encourages collaboration. 

Contributions have to meet the following requirements to keep the version history clean:

- Contributions must always contain a proper description of their content. Start with a concise one-line description. Then, elaborate on reasoning for the choices made, descriptions for reviewers and other information that might otherwise be lost.
- All new features, content changes and enhancements require explanation in order for them to be accepted. 
- Comment in the marked-up word document on every change. This helps reviewers to keep up-to-date with changes.
- All contributions should add a feature or change content.

If contributions do not follow the above guidelines, we may request further changes.

If contributions do not match the brief, we are under no obligation to accept them.

## ASP maintainers
The maintainers are a small group who work in collaboration with each other. Their primary role is to review and progress contributions.
Responsibilities:
- Guide contributors by creating briefs
- Review contributions and provide feedback

## Contributions
Before contributing an enhancement (for example, additional content), please review the contributions made to date in order to avoid duplication of work, as others might be working on a related feature.

## Workflow
All content is subject to a QA process.
